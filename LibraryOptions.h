			it for getting outlines for glyphs.
		#define CPL_THROW_ON_NO_RESOURCE:
			if set, will throw an exception if cpl cannot find
			a needed resource.
		#define CPL_TRACEGUARD_ENTRYPOINTS
			if set, a top-level handler will be installed at common entry points
			(before user code in audio threads, async threads, opengl rendering etc.),
